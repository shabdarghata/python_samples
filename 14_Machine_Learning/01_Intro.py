# We can split the data types into three main categories:

# Numerical
# Categorical
# Ordinal
# Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:

# Discrete Data
# - numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
# Continuous Data
# - numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
# Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

# Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.

# By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.
